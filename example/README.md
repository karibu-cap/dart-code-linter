# Examples

DCL is a static analysis tool and code from it is not expected to be used directly. Instead, it should be added as a dev dependency and installed [as described here](https://github.com/bancolombia/dart-code-linter/blob/trunk/GETTINGSTARTED.md).

## Preferred way: plugin and CLI

To use DCL as a plugin or a CLI, check out [this repository](https://github.com/bancolombia/dart-code-linter/blob/trunk/example/lib/main.dart) with the example Flutter app. It covers DCL setup and shows all commands output.

## Additional way: as a library

**Note:** usually you don't need to use DCL directly.

DCL can be used directly as a library, imported and called from your code. Continue with [this example](https://github.com/bancolombia/dart-code-linter/blob/trunk/example/lib_example/lib/main.dart) in order to get more details.

## Presets

Presets can be enabled with `extends` config, more details [can be found here](https://github.com/bancolombia/dart-code-linter/wiki/Presets).
